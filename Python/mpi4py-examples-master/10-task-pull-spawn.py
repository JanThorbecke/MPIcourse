""" A different implementation of task-pull with less communication and full
use of resources (mainly-idle parent shares with worker). Sentinels are used in
place of tags. Start parent with 'python <filename.py>' rather than mpirun;
parent will then spawn specified number of workers. Work is randomized to
demonstrate dynamic allocation. Worker logs are collectively passed back to
parent at the end in place of results. Comments and output are both
deliberately excessive for instructional purposes. """
