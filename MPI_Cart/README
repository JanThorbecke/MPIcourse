This exercise uses some advanced MPI fucntions to set u a 2D domain decomposition.

1 check the Makefile and verify if mpiicc is available 

2 compile the code by typing 

make

3 run the code  with 16 MP tasks

mpirun -np 16 

or 

mpiexec -n 16 

or use the SLURM script job.slurm and submit the job to the cluster

The programs prints outs for each MPI task the neigbours.

Check how is the decomposition done?

Change the code to make non-peridioc boundaries in all 2 dimensions.
