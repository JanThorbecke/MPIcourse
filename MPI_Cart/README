This exercise uses some advanced MPI functions to set u a 2D domain decomposition.

1 check the Makefile and verify if mpicc is available 

2 compile the code by typing 

make

3 run the code  with 16 MP tasks

mpirun -np 16 

or 

mpiexec -n 16 

or use the SLURM script job.slurm and submit the job to the cluster

The programs prints outs for each MPI task the neigbours.

Check how is the decomposition done?

Change the code to make non-peridioc boundaries in all 2 dimensions.

***** 

The jacobi.f90 code is an example of MPI_Cart combined with MPI_Type_vector for a Poisson solver.

make jacobi
and to submit the job jacobi.slurm
