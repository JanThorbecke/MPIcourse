Exercise 4 Deadlock
Find out what the program deadlock (.c or .f90) is supposed to do. Run it with two processors and see what happens.
a) Why does the program get stuck?
b) Reorder the sends and receives in such a way that there is no deadlock.
c) Replace the sends and receives with MPI_SENDRECV.
d) Replace the standard sends with non-blocking sends to avoid deadlocking.
extra
e) Change the data to be communicated from 10^6 to 1 in the original program and run again - is there still a deadlock?
