Using send and receive
Write a simple program where every processor sends data to the next one. You may use as a starting point the basic.c or basic.f90.
The program should work as follows:
- Let ntasks be the number of the tasks.
- Every task with a rank less than ntasks-1 sends a message to task myid+1. For example, task 0 sends a message to task 1.
- The message content is an integer array of 10^6 elements
- The message tag is the receiver’s id number.
- The sender prints out the number of elements it sends and the tag number.
- All tasks with rank ≥ 1 receive messages. You should check the MPI_SOURCE and MPI_TAG fields of the
status variable (in Fortran you should check the corresponding array elements). Also check then number of
elements that the process received using MPI_Get_count.
- Each receiver prints out the number of elements it received, the message tag, and the rank 
- Write the program using MPI_Send and MPI_Recv

MPI commands to use are:

MPI_Recv(message,size,MPI_INT,MPI_ANY_SOURCE,MPI_ANY_TAG,MPI_COMM_WORLD,&status);
MPI_Get_count(&status,MPI_INT,&count);
printf("Receiver: %d. received elements: %d. Tag %d. Sender: %d.\n",myid,count,status.MPI_TAG,status.MPI_SOURCE);

MPI_Send(message,size,MPI_INT,myid+1,myid+1,MPI_COMM_WORLD);
printf("Sender: %d. Sent elements: %d. Tag: %d. Receiver: %d\n", myid,size,myid+1,myid+1);

You have to think about the logic how these calls can be included in basic.c

+ Compilation of the code:
C-code:
make c

Fortran code:
make f90
