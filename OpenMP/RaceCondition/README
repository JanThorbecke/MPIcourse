compile the racecondition example by typing:

make clean
make

set the number of threads to use

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

It does no matter if you only have 2 cores in your system, you can still run with as many threads as you like.

and run the code

./racecondition

several times. Do you always get the same answer? Run with 

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

and look into the code to check what the correct values are.
