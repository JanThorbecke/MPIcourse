Apart from parallellizing do loops, there is another method of
parallellizing chunks of code. This concept is known as parallel
sections.


1.  Take a look at the source code in file ex3.f. Determine 
    whether it is possible to use the concept of parallel 
    sections here.

    Use OpenMP directives to define parallel sections. Compile
    and execute on 1, 2, 3 and 4 processors.

    ifort -O3 ex3.f -qopenmp -o ex3 
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
    time ./ex3

    What do you observe ? What is the explanation ?


2.  Instead of using parallel sections, now parallellize the code
    using the automatic parallellization flag of the compiler. Also,
    use optimization flag -O3.

    ifort -O3 ex3.f -parallel -qopt_report=4 -o ex3 

    Check the output of the compiler and try to understand what 
    transformations the compiler has made.

    Execute the code on 1, 2, 3 and 4 processors, and determine
    the wallclock times.

    Try to find an explanation for the observed wallclock times
    and speed-ups.


3.  Use OpenMP directives to parallellize both the 20-loop and the
    30-loop. Find a way to let the code run more efficiently, i.e.
    try to improve the parallel efficiency.

    ifort -O3 ex3.f -qopt_report=4 -qopenmp -o ex3 

    (Hint: consider various scheduling policies within OpenMP.)
