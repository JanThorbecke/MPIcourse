 MPI-IO exercises

Pick any of the exercices you like to do. They are ordered in increasing complexity:

-1- mpi_io_exa1.c: MPI_File_write_at
   + cp mpi_io_exa1_skel.c my_exa1.c
   + Fill in the approrate MPI flags into the MPI-IO routines to write a file in parallel.
   + compile the file and run in parallel try as many MPI-tasks as you like. 
   + check the my_test_file output file for correctness: it write the first nrank ASCII characters for each MPI-task

-2- The demo directory contains a few examples with POSIX IO.
   + posix1_w.c : Spokesman: one tasks does all IO write
   + posix1_r.c : Spokesman: one tasks does all IO read
   + posix2_w.c : one file per process
   + posix3_w.c : subset of writers (most complicated)

-3- mpi_io_exa2.c: MPI_File_set_view
   + cp mpi_io_exa2_skel.c my_exa2.c
   + Fill in the approrate MPI flags into the MPI-IO routines to write a file in parallel.
   + compile the file and run in parallel use a few MPI-tasks to keep the overview. 

-4a- mpiio_2D_w.c: MPI_File_write_all
  + without running the program draw a 2D figure that contains the output of the program, by inspecting the source code.
  + compile (mpicc mpiio_2D_w.c -lm) and run the program and check your drawing
  + you can check the file with: od -i test.dat -w128

-4b- Collective MPI-IO examples
   + mpiio1_w.c: MPI_File_write_at_all
   + mpiio1_r.c: MPI_File_read_at_all
